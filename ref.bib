Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions.    On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.}

This problem is at the heart of training scalable machine learning models and has been mainly studied in the unconstrained setting. In this paper, we propose Quantised Frank-Wolfe (QFW), the first projection free and communication-efficient algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems at scale. We consider both convex and non-convex objective functions, expressed as a finite-sum or more generally a stochastic optimization problem, and provide strong theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate of QFW. This is accomplished by proposing novel quantization schemes that efficiently compress gradients while controlling the noise variance intduced during this process. Finally, we empirically validate the efficiency of QFW in terms of communication and the quality of returned solution against natural baselines.}

  abstract={In a current power system, numbers of distribution networks are physically connected to a transmission network at different boundary buses. As the planning solution of one network significantly influences the decisions made by planners of other networks, the transmission and distribution networks should coordinate and cooperate with each other to design the entire power system in a secure and economic manner. Inspired by decentralized and hierarchical optimization theories, this paper proposes a coordinated decision-making framework to determine the planning scheme and scenario based generation schedule for integrated transmission and distribution networks (ITDNs) with the penetration of distributed generations (DGs). A stochastic bi-level hierarchy is presented to decompose the centralized optimal planning of ITDNs. The obtained subproblems for independent transmission and distribution networks are formulated and relaxed to convex models. An improved iterative solution procedure is developed by exploiting the cascaded structure of the problems. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the convergence properties of the decentralized optimization algorithm. The proposed coordinated planning framework outperforms conventional independent methods by decreasing expansion investment and improving DG accommodation.},

	abstract = {Modern machine learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes incrementally. The performance dramatically degrades due to the missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these methods struggle to scale up to a large number of classes. We believe this is because of the combination of two factors: (a) the data imbalance between the old and new classes, and (b) the increasing number of visually similar classes. Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced. We propose a simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and this bias can be corrected by a linear model. With two bias parameters, our method performs remarkably well on two large datasets: ImageNet (1000 classes) and MS-Celeb-1M (10000 classes), outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by 11.1\% and 13.2\% respectively.},

The problem is addressed by adapting a recently proposed incremental learning approach, called ‘learning without forgetting’. While an incremental learning approach assumes data availability in a sequence, nodes of the decentralized scenario can not share data between them and there is no master node. Nodes can communicate information about model parameters among neighbors. Communication of model parameters is the key to adapt the ‘learning without forgetting’ approach to the decentralized scenario. We use random walk based communication to handle a highly limited communication resource.},

	abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been recently recognized as a promising optimizer for large-scale machine learning models. However, there are very few results studying ADMM from the aspect of communication costs, especially jointly with privacy preservation, which are critical for distributed learning. We investigate the communication efficiency and privacy-preservation of ADMM by solving the consensus optimization problem over decentralized networks. Since walk algorithms can reduce communication load, we first propose incremental ADMM (I-ADMM) based on the walk algorithm, the updating order of which follows a Hamiltonian cycle instead. However, I-ADMM cannot guarantee the privacy for agents against external eavesdroppers even if the randomized initialization is applied. To protect privacy for agents, we then propose two privacy-preserving incremental ADMM algorithms, i.e., PI-ADMM1 and PI-ADMM2, where perturbation over step sizes and primal variables is adopted, respectively. Through theoretical analyses, we prove the convergence and privacy preservation for PI-ADMM1, which are further supported by numerical experiments. Besides, simulations demonstrate that the proposed PI-ADMM1 and PI-ADMM2 algorithms are communication efficient compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Buildings account for roughly 40\% of the total energy consumption in the world, out of which heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are the major contributors. Traditional heating controllers are inefficient due to lack of adaptability to dynamic conditions such as changing user preferences and outside temperature patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to design energy-efficient controllers that can improvise occupant thermal comfort (deviation from setpoint temperature) while reducing energy consumption. This research presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based heating controller to improve thermal comfort and minimize energy costs in smart buildings. We perform extensive simulation experiments using real-world outside temperature data. The results show that the DRL-based smart controller outperforms a traditional thermostat controller by improving thermal comfort between 15\% and 30\% and reducing energy costs between 5\% and 12\% in the simulated environment. A second set of experiments is then performed for the case of multiple buildings, each having its own heating equipment. The performance is compared when the buildings are controlled centrally (using a single DRL-based controller) versus decentralized control, where each heater is controlled independently and has its own DRL-based controller. We observe that as the number of buildings and differences in their setpoint temperatures increase, decentralized control performs better than a centralized controller. The results have practical implications for heating control, especially in areas with multiple buildings such as residential complexes with multiple houses.},
